# MUSIC-AVQA-v2.0
Data Release for the paper [Tackling Data Bias in MUSIC-AVQA: Crafting a Balanced Dataset for Unbiased Question-Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06238) (Accepted by WACV 2024) by Xiulong Liu, Zhikang Dong and Peng Zhang.

The paper solves the data bias issue of original MUSIC-AVQA dataset by manually collecting 1230 musical instrument performance videos along with 8.1k newly created QA pairs complementing to the original biased QA set.

We will include additional videos data and QA pairs after balancing the original [MUSIC-AVQA Dataset](https://gewu-lab.github.io/MUSIC-AVQA/) under this repository. The videos are manually collected from YouTube, and can be used under research purposes only. We will release the videos via YouTube-ids along with the trimmed start-time and end-time for each video. If you have any issues downloading or cutting the specific videos, please feel free to contact us at [link](xl1995@uw.edu). To access the original MUSIC-AVQA videos, you could directly find the links from [MUSIC-AVQA Dataset](https://gewu-lab.github.io/MUSIC-AVQA/). I
